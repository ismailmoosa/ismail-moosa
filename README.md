I have taken alot of notes from my lecturer and put it to good us.
This was one of the most challenging work I have done so far in my life but I am proud of it.
I have had many challenges in this year...but i am loving every bit of it.

This app is built using PhoneGap,Angular JS and alot of HTML and hardly any css due to time constraints.

Enjoy it!
